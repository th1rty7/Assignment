    <title>Some instruments I enjoyed listening recently</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello and welcome to my assignment webpage</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the instruments I find very mesmerizing, something that I could sink my head into for a very long time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Guitar</li>

        <figcaption>(^ Example of someone using the guitar.)</figcaption>
        <p>I mean, what else could I possibly say about the guitar? After all, this instrument is literally the backbone for many genre out there, and it is used in the songs that I normally hear as well.</p>
        <p>If you're interested about this instrument, click <a href="https://www.mi.edu/education/guitar-history-how-the-guitar-has-evolved/">here</a> to learn more.</p>
    
        <li>Drums</li>

        <figcaption>(^ Popular example of a drum (I know there are many differnet concepts and designs of this instrument, but let's just pick this one)).</figcaption>
        <p>Ah yes, the drums, whether classic or electronic, it is a staple for the creation of many beats and melody we hear today in our songs.</p>
        <p>Read <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-drums">this article</a> if you want to take a look at the history and the development of it.</p>
        <li>Piano</li>

        <figcaption>(^ Image of a modern piano.)</figcaption>
        <p>One of the oldest yet most influental instruments of all time. The piano has stood against the test of time and has maintain it's status in our current timeline. I remember seeing videos of songs or covers being played by the piano, which is kinda insane to me.</p>
        <p>I think this <a href="https://www.flowkey.com/en/piano-history-pop-music">post</a> should give you a brighter idea about it's influence.</p>

        <p>I guess that's pretty much it. Thanks for reading/reviewing this code and have a nice day!</p>
